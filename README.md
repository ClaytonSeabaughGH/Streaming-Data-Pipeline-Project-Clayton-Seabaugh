# Streaming Data Pipeline Project: Clayton Seabaugh 

Welcome to Clayton Seabaugh's Data Pipeline Project, where real-time data streaming meets powerful analytics! 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This system consists of both a Kafka Producer and a Kafka Consumer to handle real-time streaming of JSON messages related to song attributes. The producer sends song data to a Kafka topic, while the consumer processes the messages, performs sentiment analysis, and stores them in an SQLite database. It also generates insightful graphs for visualization.

## Features
### Producer Features
- **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Sends song-related JSON messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Dynamic Message Generation**: Simulates song metadata including title, artist, genre, duration, release year, and sentiment.
- **Customizable Configuration**: Modify parameters such as message frequency and Kafka topic via environment variables.

### Consumer Features
- **Live Kafka Consumption**: Fetches messages in real-time from a Kafka topic.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes song attributes and assigns a sentiment score.
- **SQLite Integration**: Stores processed messages for future analysis.
- **Graph Generation**: Creates visual representations of release trends, sentiment over time, and genre distribution.
- **Logging & Alerts**: Tracks operations and ensures transparent debugging.

## How It Works
1. Kafka Producer generates song data and sends it to a Kafka topic.
2. Kafka Consumer retrieves messages from the topic, processes them, and performs analysis.
3. **Database Storage**: Processed messages are inserted into an SQLite database.
4. **Graph Generation**: Consumer generates graphs showcasing trends in music data.

## Setup & Execution
### 1️. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have all required Python packages installed:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️. Install & Start Kafka
#### **Windows (Using WSL) & Linux:**
```sh
wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.5.1/kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz
```
```sh
tar -xvzf kafka_2.13-3.5.1.tgz
cd kafka_2.13-3.5.1
```
Start Kafka services:
```sh
cd ~/kafka
chmod +x zookeeper-server-start.sh
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties 


cd ~/kafka
chmod +x kafka-server-start.sh
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties 

```
### **MacOS (Using Homebrew)**
```sh
brew install kafka
```
Start Kafka services:
```sh
brew services start zookeeper
brew services start kafka
```
Create a Kafka topic:
```sh
kafka-topics --create --topic song-stream --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
```

### 3️. Configure Environment Variables
Use a `.env` file or `utils_config` module to set up:
- Kafka topic
- Kafka broker address
- Producer message interval
- Consumer group ID
- SQLite database file path

### 4️. Start the Kafka Producer
Run the producer to send song data:

Windows:
```sh
py -m kafka_producer_seabaugh.py
```
Mac/Linux:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m producers.producer_song_attributes
```

### 5️. Start the Kafka Consumer
Run the consumer to process and store messages:

Windows:
```sh
py -m kafka_consumer_seabaugh.py
```
Mac/Linux:
```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m consumers.kafka_consumer_song_attributes
```

## Data Visualization
Once messages are processed, the consumer generates graphs:
- **Song Release Trends**: Line graph of release years over time.
- **Sentiment Analysis Over Time**: Tracks how song sentiment evolves by release year.
- **Genre Distribution**: Bar chart showing the frequency of different genres.

Graphs are saved as `combined_graphs.png` in the working directory.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time dashboard for visualization 
- Integration with external databases like PostgreSQL 
- Machine learning-powered sentiment analysis 

## Final Words 
With Clayton Seabaugh's Data Pipeline, you can efficiently stream, process, and analyze music data in real-time. Whether you're tracking trends or diving deep into sentiment analysis, this system has you covered. Happy streaming! 🎶
